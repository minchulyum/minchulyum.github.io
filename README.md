### Welcome!

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/). I am on leave at [Goethe University Frankfurt](https://www.wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de/en/departments/money-and-macroeconomics/home.html) during the academic year 2019-20. I am a member of the Collaborative Research Center Transregio 224 ([CRC TR 224](https://www.crctr224.de/en/about)), funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).

My main research interests lie in macroeconomics and family economics.

  <summary markdown="span">"General Equilibrium Feedback Regarding the Employment Effects of Labor Taxes"
    
  ***Macroeconomic Dynamics***, forthcoming</summary>
  
  
  **Abstract**: A higher labor tax rate increases the equilibrium real interest rate and reduces the equilibrium wage in a heterogeneous-agent model with endogenous savings and indivisible labor supply decisions. I show that these general equilibrium (GE) adjustments, in particular of the real interest rate, reinforce the negative employment impact of higher labor taxes. However, the representative-agent version of the model, which generates similar aggregate employment responses to labor tax changes, implies that GE feedback is neutral. The cross-country panel data reveal that the negative association between labor tax rates and the extensive margin labor supply is significantly and robustly weaker in small open economies where the interest rate is less tightly linked to domestic circumstances. This empirical evidence supports the transmission mechanism of labor tax changes for employment in the heterogeneous-agent model.

  <summary markdown="span">"On the Distribution of Wealth and Employment"    

  ***Review of Economic Dynamics***, October 2018, 30, 86-105</summary>
  
  
  **Abstract**: In the United States, the employment rate is nearly flat across wealth quintiles with the exception of the first quintile. Correlations between wealth and employment are close to zero or moderately positive. However, incomplete markets models with a standard utility function counterfactually generate a strongly negative relationship between wealth and employment. Using a fairly standard incomplete markets model calibrated to match the distribution of wealth, I find that government transfers and capital income taxation increase the (non-targeted) correlations between wealth and employment substantially, bringing the model closer to the data. As the model's fit with the distribution of wealth and employment improves, I find that the precautionary motive of labor supply is mitigated, thereby raising aggregate labor supply elasticities substantially.

### Working Papers:
<details>
  <summary markdown="span">"Nonlinear Occupations and Female Labor Supply Over Time"
    
  (with [Youngsoo Jang](https://sites.google.com/site/youngsoojangecon/))</summary>
  
  
  **Abstract**: High hours worked and higher returns to longer hours worked are common in many occupations, namely nonlinear occupations (Goldin 2014). Over the last four decades, both the share and relative wage premium of nonlinear occupations have been rising. Females have been facing rising experience premiums especially in nonlinear occupations. To quantitatively explore how these changes affected female labor supply over time, we build a quantitative, dynamic general equilibrium model of occupational choice and labor supply at both extensive and intensive margins. A decomposition analysis finds that the rising returns to experience, especially in nonlinear occupations, and technical change biased towards nonlinear occupations are important to explain the intensive margin of female labor supply that keeps rising even in the recent period during which female employment stagnates. Finally, a counterfactual experiment suggests that if the nonlinearities were to be gradually vanishing, female employment could have been higher at the expense of significantly lower intensive margin labor supply.

  <summary markdown="span">"Status Externalities and Low Birth Rates in Korea"
    
  (with [Seongeun Kim](https://sites.google.com/site/sekimphd/) and [Mich√®le Tertilt](http://tertilt.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/))</summary>
  
  
  **Abstract**: South Koreans seem obsessed with education -- many children spend most of their after-school time in private cramming schools,  and families spend more on private after-school programs than anywhere else in the world. At the same time, South Korea has the lowest birth rate in the world. In this paper we highlight a novel mechanism that might connect these two facts. Key to the mechanism is the assumption that parents care about the \textit{relative} human capital  of their offspring, leading to an externality in education investments. We build a quantitative model with heterogeneous agents with this status externality. We calibrate the model to Korean data and explore how the externality affects parents along the income distribution. We find that the status externality increases human capital and depresses fertility, especially at the bottom of the income distribution, relative to a world without the externality. We then explore how various government policies affect fertility, education and welfare across generations. We first explore whether simply taxing education reduces the distortion caused by the externality. We find that while it reduces education, it depresses fertility even further. This increases welfare of the first generation of parents at the expense of welfare losses for future generations. The reason is that future generations now suffer from lower human capital. Pro-natal transfers, on the other hand, do increase the fertility rate and lower education. Still, this policy is not welfare-improving for any generation. Finally, we explore government subsidized daycare which effectively reduces the time cost of having children. This policy increases fertility, reduces education and leads to welfare gains for all generations. We conclude that if status externalities in education are indeed as important in East Asia as is commonly believed, then policies to correct the distortion need to be carefully chosen.

  <summary markdown="span">"Heterogeneity, Transfer Progressivity and Business Cycles"
    
  (with [Youngsoo Jang](https://sites.google.com/site/youngsoojangecon/) and [Takeki Sunakawa](https://tkksnk.github.io/))</summary>
  
  
  **Abstract**: This paper studies how transfer progressivity influences aggregate fluctuations when interacted with household heterogeneity. Using a simple static model of the extensive margin labor supply, we analytically characterize how transfer progressivity influences differential labor supply responses to aggregate conditions across heterogeneous households. We then build a quantitative dynamic general equilibrium model with both idiosyncratic and aggregate productivity shocks and show that the model delivers moderately procyclical average labor productivity and a large cyclical volatility of aggregate hours relative to output. Counterfactual exercises show that redistributive policies have very different implications for aggregate fluctuations, depending on whether tax progressivity or transfer progressivity is used. We provide empirical evidence on the heterogeneity of employment responses across the wage distribution, which supports the key model mechanism.

  <summary markdown="span">"Parental Time Investment and Intergenerational Mobility"</summary>
  
  
  **Abstract**: This paper constructs a quantitative model of intergenerational mobility in which lifetime income mobility is shaped by various channels including parental time investments in children. The calibrated model delievers positive educational gradients in parental time investment, as observed in the data, and also successfully accounts for untargeted distributional aspects of income mobility, captured in the income quintile transition matrix. The model implies that removing the positive educational gradients in parental time investment during the whole childhood would reduce intergenerational income persistence nearly by 40 percent. Policy experiments suggest that subsidies to childhood investments that can diminish positive educational gradients in parental time investments would increase intergenerational mobility, and that there are better ways of subsidizing investments to achieve greater mobility in terms of aggregate output and welfare.
