I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/). I am on leave at [Goethe University Frankfurt](https://www.wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de/en/departments/money-and-macroeconomics/home.html) during the academic year 2019-20. I am a member of the Collaborative Research Center Transregio 224 ([CRC TR 224](https://www.crctr224.de/en/about)), funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).
